```

### Event Handlers Implemented
1. **`onBlockBreak(BlockBreakEvent)`** - Prevents block destruction
2. **`onBlockPlace(BlockPlaceEvent)`** - Prevents block placement
3. **`onPlayerInteract(PlayerInteractEvent)`** - Controls block interactions
4. **`onPlayerInteractEntity(PlayerInteractEntityEvent)`** - Controls entity interactions
5. **`onEntityPickupItem(EntityPickupItemEvent)`** - Prevents item pickup
6. **`onPlayerDropItem(PlayerDropItemEvent)`** - Prevents item dropping
7. **`onInventoryOpen(InventoryOpenEvent)`** - Blocks container access
8. **`onInventoryClick(InventoryClickEvent)`** - Prevents container manipulation
9. **`onEntityDamageByEntity(EntityDamageByEntityEvent)`** - Prevents PVP
10. **`onGameModeChange(PlayerGameModeChangeEvent)`** - Enforces adventure mode

### Key Methods
- **`isVisitorRestricted(Player)`**: Determines if player should be restricted
- **`sendRestrictionMessage(Player, String)`**: Sends contextual restriction messages
- **Integration with Island role system**: Uses `Island.CoopRole.VISITOR` checking

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Visitors
