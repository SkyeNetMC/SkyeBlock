Successfully implemented a comprehensive island visiting and coop system for the SkyeBlock plugin, transforming the basic skyblock experience into a feature-rich multiplayer environment with advanced access controls, customization options, and social features.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🎯 Core Island Visiting System
- **Enhanced `/is visit` Command**: Moved from standalone `/visit` to `/is visit` with GUI support
- **Island Browser GUI**: Player-head based interface showing all islands with voting counts and online status

### 🔒 Island Security & Access Control
- **Island Locking**: `/is lock` and `/is unlock` commands to control access
- **Adventure Mode Protection**: Automatic adventure mode enforcement for visitors
- **Visitor Restrictions**: Comprehensive protection preventing unauthorized actions:
  - Block breaking/placing prevention
  - Container access protection (chests, furnaces, etc.)
  - Item pickup/drop restrictions
  - Redstone component interaction limits (allows safe items like buttons)
  - Game mode change prevention

### 🤝 Advanced Coop System
