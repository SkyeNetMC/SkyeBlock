# SBA Command Registration - FIXED

## Issue Resolution
The SBA command was not working because it was only defined in the root `plugin.yml` file but missing from the `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` file that gets packaged with the plugin.

## Fix Applied
✅ **Added SBA command definition to `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`:**

```yaml
sba:
  description: SkyeBlock Admin command (bypasses all restrictions)
  usage: /sba <island|create|delete|visit|hub|reload|debug|bypass> [args...]
  permission: skyeblock.admin
  aliases: [skyeblockadmin]
```

## Verification Results
✅ **Command Registration**: SBA command properly defined in plugin.yml  
✅ **Command Class**: SkyeBlockAdminCommand.java exists and compiles  
✅ **Plugin Registration**: Command registration code present in SkyeBlockPlugin.java  
✅ **Permissions**: `skyeblock.admin` permission defined with `default: op`  
✅ **Build Status**: Plugin compiles successfully  

## Command Usage
- **Command**: `/sba <subcommand> [args...]`
- **Permission**: `skyeblock.admin` (OPs have this by default)
- **Aliases**: `/skyeblockadmin`
- **Subcommands**: island, create, delete, visit, hub, reload, debug, bypass

## Key Features
- **Admin Bypass**: Bypasses all island restrictions and cooldowns
- **Full Access**: Can create/delete unlimited islands
- **Debug Tools**: Includes debugging and status commands
- **Permission Integration**: Works with LuckPerms and default OP permissions

## Testing
The SBA command should now be available in-game for all operators and users with the `skyeblock.admin` permission.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - SBA command is now properly registered and functional.
