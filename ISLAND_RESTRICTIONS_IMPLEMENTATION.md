# Island Deletion Restrictions & Teleportation Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This implementation adds stricter island deletion controls and improves teleportation behavior as requested:

### 🎯 **Primary Changes**

1. **📍 Teleport to Spawn on Missing Island**
   - `/is tp`, `/is home`, and `/island tp` now teleport to spawn if no island is found
   - Shows user-friendly message: "No island found! Teleporting to spawn."

2. **⏰ Extended Cooldown Period**
   - Increased from 5 minutes (300s) to **1 hour (3600s)**
   - Time display now shows hours, minutes, and seconds

3. **🚫 Persistent Cooldown System**
   - Cooldown remains active even after reaching the 3-deletion limit
   - Players must still wait during cooldown period regardless of deletion count

4. **🛑 Deletion Limit Enforcement**
   - Players **cannot delete** their island once they reach the 3rd deletion
   - Clear error message prevents confusion

5. **🔧 Admin Bypass Enhancement**
   - `/sba` commands bypass **ALL** restrictions:
     - 1-hour cooldown
     - 3-deletion limit
     - Location requirements
     - Permission checks

## 📂 **Files Modified**

### 1. **Configuration** (`src/main/resources/config.yml`)
```yaml
# Changed cooldown from 5 minutes to 1 hour
island:
  create-island:
    delay: 3600  # Was: 300
```

### 2. **Island Manager** (`IslandManager.java`)
- **`teleportToIsland(Player)`**: Auto-teleport to spawn if no island
- **`canDeleteIsland(Player)`**: Enhanced deletion restrictions
- **`formatTime(long)`**: Helper for hour/minute/second formatting
- **Updated time formatting**: Throughout all cooldown messages

### 3. **Admin Commands** (`SkyeBlockAdminCommand.java`)
- **Enhanced bypass descriptions**: Updated for 1-hour cooldown
- **Improved admin messaging**: Clarifies full restriction bypass

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: No Island Teleportation
```bash
# Player without island attempts teleportation
/island tp
# Result: Teleports to spawn with message
```

### Scenario 2: Deletion Limit Reached
```bash
# Player who has deleted 3 islands tries to delete again
/delete
# Result: "You have reached the maximum number of island deletions (3). You cannot delete islands anymore."
```

### Scenario 3: Cooldown Restriction
```bash
# Player tries to delete during 1-hour cooldown
/delete
# Result: "You cannot delete your island while on cooldown. Time remaining: 45 minutes and 23 seconds"
```

### Scenario 4: Admin Bypass
```bash
# Admin bypasses all restrictions
/sba delete
# Result: Deletion succeeds regardless of cooldown/limits
```

### Scenario 5: Creation After Limit
```bash
# Player with 3 deletions tries to create new island
/island create classic
# Result: "You have reached the maximum number of island deletions (3). You cannot create new islands."
```

## 🔧 **Admin Tools**

### Debug Commands
```bash
/sba debug cooldown <player>     # Check player's deletion status
/sba bypass deletion             # Show deletion bypass info
/island status                   # System status overview
```

### Admin Bypass Commands
```bash
/sba delete [player]            # Delete with full bypass
/sba create [type]              # Create with full bypass
/sba island [args]              # Island management with bypass
```
