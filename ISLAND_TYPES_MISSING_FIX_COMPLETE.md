# Island Types Missing Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Identified
The island types were not showing in the Create Island GUI because the code was trying to use schematic manager's available types instead of our predefined island types array.

## Root Cause
In the `openCreationGUI` method, the code was:
1. Getting available types from `plugin.getSchematicManager().getAvailableSchematics()`
2. Passing these to `addIslandTypeItems(inventory, availableTypes)`
3. But the `addIslandTypeItems` method was actually ignoring the `availableTypes` parameter and using our predefined `ISLAND_TYPES` array

This created a disconnect where the method expected external schematic data but was designed to use internal island type definitions.

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed SchematicManager Dependency**: Removed the call to `getAvailableSchematics()` 
2. **Updated Method Signature**: Changed `addIslandTypeItems(Inventory inventory, String[] availableTypes)` to `addIslandTypeItems(Inventory inventory)`
3. **Simplified Method Call**: Changed to `addIslandTypeItems(inventory)` without the unused parameter

## Result
The GUI will now properly display all 19 island types organized by difficulty:

### Easy Islands (Green) - Row 1 (Slots 10-16):
1. vanilla - The classic skyblock experience
2. beginner - Perfect starting island for new players  
3. Mossy cavern - Underground cave with moss and nature
4. Famers Dream - Agricultural paradise for farming
5. Mineshaft - Old mining operation with resources
6. Cozy Grove - Peaceful forest retreat
7. bare bones - Minimal starting resources

### Medium Islands (Yellow) - Row 2 (Slots 19-23):
8. Campsite - Outdoor adventure base camp
