3. **Wasteland** - Post-apocalyptic survival
4. **Bone** - Skeletal remains in harsh environment
5. **Planked** - Limited to wooden resources only
6. **Dirt** - Basic dirt with no extras

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```java
private static final IslandType[] ISLAND_TYPES = {
    // Easy Islands (Green)
    new IslandType("Classic", "The traditional skyblock experience", Material.GRASS_BLOCK, Difficulty.EASY),
    // ... (all 20 island types)
};

private enum Difficulty {
    EASY, MEDIUM, HARD
}

private static class IslandType {
    final String name;
    final String description;
    final Material material;
    final Difficulty difficulty;
}
```

### GUI Layout
- **Slot Positions**: Organized in 4 rows with proper spacing
  - Row 1 (Easy): Slots 10-14 (5 islands)
  - Row 2 (Easy): Slots 19-21 (3 islands)
  - Row 3 (Medium): Slots 28-33 (6 islands)
  - Row 4 (Hard): Slots 37-42 (6 islands)

### Color Coding System
- **Easy Islands**: `<green>` name color
- **Medium Islands**: `<yellow>` name color  
- **Hard Islands**: `<red>` name color
- **Difficulty Display**: Shows colored difficulty level in lore

### Features Implemented
1. **Dynamic Item Creation**: Each island type gets appropriate material and colors
2. **Difficulty Information**: Shows difficulty level in item lore
3. **Visual Selection**: Enchantment glow effect on selected items
4. **Smart Feedback**: Player messages include difficulty information
5. **Organized Layout**: Islands ordered by difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)

## Updated Methods
- `addIslandTypeItems()`: Updated slot positions and island type creation
- `createIslandTypeItem()`: Complete rewrite with difficulty-based coloring
- `handleIslandTypeSelection()`: Enhanced with difficulty feedback
- `updateSelectionVisuals()`: Updated slot positions for new layout

## Benefits
1. **Clear Difficulty Progression**: Visual organization helps players choose appropriate challenge
2. **Color-Coded Interface**: Immediate visual feedback on difficulty levels
3. **Descriptive Names**: Each island type has a clear, thematic name
4. **Detailed Information**: Descriptions explain what makes each island unique
5. **Balanced Selection**: Good distribution across difficulty levels

## Compilation Status
✅ **COMPILATION SUCCESSFUL** - All code compiles without errors
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - Plugin packages correctly
✅ **NO ERRORS** - Clean implementation with no compilation issues

## Files Modified
- `IslandCreationGUI.java` - Complete island types system implementation

The island types system is now fully implemented with proper difficulty organization, color coding, and enhanced user experience!
