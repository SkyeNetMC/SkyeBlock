echo "=== Updated Island Deletion & Creation Logic ==="
echo

echo "✅ NEW LOGIC IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "========================="
echo
echo "🔄 SEQUENCE: create → delete → create → delete → create → delete (3rd) → COOLDOWN"
echo
echo "📋 Step-by-Step Flow:"
echo "1. Player creates island #1"
echo "2. Player deletes island #1 (1/3 deletions used)"
echo "3. Player creates island #2"
echo "4. Player deletes island #2 (2/3 deletions used)"
echo "5. Player creates island #3"
echo "6. Player deletes island #3 (3/3 deletions used) ✅ ALLOWED"
echo "7. Player tries to create island #4 → ❌ BLOCKED by 1-hour cooldown"
echo "8. After 1 hour: Player can create again (deletion count resets to 0/3)"
echo

echo "✅ KEY CHANGES:"
echo "==============="
echo "• ✅ Players CAN delete their 3rd island"
echo "• ⏰ After 3rd deletion, players get 1-hour cooldown for CREATION"
echo "• 🔄 After cooldown expires, deletion count resets (new cycle begins)"
echo "• 🔧 Admins with skyeblock.admin bypass all restrictions"
echo

echo "✅ UPDATED METHODS:"
echo "==================="
echo "📂 IslandManager.java:"
echo "   • canDeleteIsland() - Removed max tries check, allows 3rd deletion"
echo "   • canCreateIsland() - Added cooldown check after 3 deletions"
echo "   • deleteIsland() - Updated messages for new logic"
echo

echo "✅ TESTING SCENARIOS:"
echo "====================="
echo
echo "🧪 Test Case 1: Normal Deletion Flow"
echo "   1st deletion: Shows 'Warning: You have 2 deletion(s) remaining out of 3'"
echo "   2nd deletion: Shows 'Warning: You have 1 deletion(s) remaining out of 3'"
echo "   3rd deletion: Shows 'You have used all 3 deletions. You must wait 1 hour...'"
echo

echo "🧪 Test Case 2: Creation After 3rd Deletion"
echo "   Command: /island create classic"
echo "   Result: 'You must wait [time] before creating a new island.'"
echo

echo "🧪 Test Case 3: Admin Bypass"
echo "   Admin can always delete and create regardless of limits/cooldowns"
echo

echo "🧪 Test Case 4: Cooldown Expiry"
echo "   After 1 hour: Deletion count resets to 0, new cycle begins"
echo

echo "✅ VERIFICATION COMMANDS:"
echo "========================="
echo "/island create [type]     - Test creation (blocked after 3rd deletion)"
echo "/island delete            - Test deletion (allowed even on 3rd island)"
echo "/sba debug cooldown       - Check player's deletion count and cooldown"
echo

echo "📝 CONFIG MESSAGES UPDATED:"
echo "==========================="
echo "• deletion-cooldown-info: Now mentions creation restriction, not deletion"
echo "• Cooldown is 3600 seconds (1 hour) - configurable via config.yml"
echo

echo "🚀 Ready for testing!"
echo "Players can now delete their 3rd island but must wait 1 hour to create again."
