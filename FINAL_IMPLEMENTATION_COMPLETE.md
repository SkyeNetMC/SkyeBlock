# SkyeBlock Plugin - Final Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 All Requested Features Successfully Implemented

### ✅ Island Deletion Cooldown System
- **Implementation**: After a player deletes 2 islands, they must wait 1 hour (configurable) before deleting their 3rd island
- **Logic**: 
  - Players can delete their 1st and 2nd islands immediately
  - 3rd island deletion requires 1-hour cooldown from the 2nd deletion
  - After cooldown expires, the counter resets and they can delete again
  - Island creation is ALWAYS allowed (no cooldown restrictions)
  - Admins with `skyeblock.admin` permission bypass all restrictions
- **Configuration**: Cooldown duration configurable in `config.yml` under `island.create-island.delay` (default: 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
- **Messages**: Proper user feedback with remaining cooldown time display

### ✅ Server Brand Functionality Removal
- **Complete Removal**: All server brand related code, commands, permissions, and documentation removed
- **Cleaned Files**: 
  - Removed from `SkyeBlockPlugin.java`
  - Removed from `plugin.yml` (both root and packaged versions)
  - Removed related imports and classes
  - Cleaned up configuration files

### ✅ SBA Command Registration
- **Status**: Fully functional and properly registered
- **Command**: `/sba` (aliases: `/skyeblockadmin`)
- **Permission**: `skyeblock.admin`
- **Registration**: Properly defined in `plugin.yml` and registered in `SkyeBlockPlugin.java`
- **Features**: Admin bypass for all island restrictions

### ✅ Island Teleport Fix (Post-Restart Issue)
- **Problem**: `/is tp` would fail after server restart because island data wasn't loaded
- **Solution**: Added fallback reload logic to `teleportToIsland` method
- **Implementation**: 
  - If island data not found in memory, attempt to reload from disk
  - Added `loadIsland(UUID)` method to `IslandDataManager`
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Fallback to spawn if island truly doesn't exist
