# Island Deletion Cooldown Logic Update - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully updated the island deletion and cooldown logic according to the new requirements and removed all server brand functionality.

## New Logic Flow
```
Player creates island (1st)
    ↓
Player deletes island (1st deletion)
    ↓
Player creates island (2nd)
    ↓
Player deletes island (2nd deletion)
    ↓
Player creates island (3rd)
    ↓
Player CANNOT delete island for 1 hour (configurable cooldown)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. IslandManager.java Updates

#### canDeleteIsland(Player) Method
- **Before**: Allowed deletion of 3rd island, only restricted creation afterwards
- **After**: After 2 deletions, blocks deletion of 3rd island until cooldown expires
- **Logic**: Checks deletion count ≥ 2, then enforces cooldown before allowing next deletion
- **Reset**: When cooldown expires, resets deletion count to 0 for new cycle

#### canCreateIsland(Player) Method  
- **Before**: Blocked creation after 3 deletions until cooldown
- **After**: No restrictions on creation - players can always create islands
- **Simplification**: Removed all cooldown checks for creation

#### deleteIsland(Player) Method
- **Updated Messages**: 
  - After 1st deletion: Warning about upcoming restriction
  - After 2nd deletion: Notification about cooldown for next deletion

### 2. Configuration Updates (config.yml)
```yaml
# Updated message strings
deletion-warning: "<yellow>Warning: You have {remaining} deletion(s) remaining before cooldown restriction applies.</yellow>"
deletion-cooldown-info: "<yellow>You have made {current} deletions. You must wait {time} before being able to delete your next island.</yellow>"
deletion-blocked-cooldown: "<red>You cannot delete your island while on cooldown. Time remaining: {time}</red>"
```

### 3. Server Brand Removal
Completely removed all server brand functionality:

#### Deleted Files:
- `ServerBrandUtil.java`
- `ServerBrandListener.java` 
- `ServerBrandChanger.java`
- `SpigotBrandModifier.java`
- `README_SERVER_BRAND.md`
- `SERVER_BRAND_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `test-server-brand.sh`

#### Code Cleanup:
- Removed server brand imports from `SkyeBlockPlugin.java`
- Removed server brand variables and getter methods
- Cleaned up `PlayerJoinListener.java` to only handle hub teleportation
- Removed `serverbrand` command from `plugin.yml` files
- Removed `skyeblock.admin.serverbrand` permission

## Admin Bypass
- Admins with `skyeblock.admin` permission bypass ALL restrictions
- Can delete unlimited islands without cooldown
- Can create unlimited islands

## Configuration Settings
```yaml
island:
  create-island:
    delay: 3600        # Cooldown in seconds (1 hour default)
    tries: 3           # Still used for tracking (but logic changed)
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Regular Player Flow:
1. Create island → Delete (1st) → Get warning about remaining deletions
2. Create island → Delete (2nd) → Get cooldown notification  
3. Create island → Try to delete → BLOCKED for 1 hour
4. Wait 1 hour → Can delete again (count resets)

### Admin Player:
- Can delete any number of islands immediately
- No cooldown restrictions apply

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- All compilation errors resolved
- Plugin compiles cleanly with new logic
- Ready for deployment and testing
