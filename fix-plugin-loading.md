# ðŸ”§ SkyeBlock Plugin Loading Fix - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Identified
The plugin was failing to load with this error:
```
Cannot invoke "org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand.setExecutor(org.bukkit.command.CommandExecutor)" because the return value of "skyeblock.nobleskye.dev.skyeblock.SkyeBlockPlugin.getCommand(String)" is null
```

## Root Cause
The `convertislands` command was missing from the `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` file, which is what Maven uses to build the JAR. The plugin code was trying to register a command that wasn't defined in the plugin.yml.

## Fix Applied âœ…
1. **Added `convertislands` command** to `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`:
   ```yaml
   convertislands:
     description: Convert old island format to new UUID-based format
     usage: /convertislands <scan|convert> [username]
     permission: skyeblock.admin.convert
   ```

2. **Added permission** to the permissions section:
   ```yaml
   skyeblock.admin.convert:
     description: Convert old island format to new UUID format
     default: op
   ```

3. **Rebuilt the plugin** with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

## Verification âœ…
- âœ… Plugin builds successfully
- âœ… `convertislands` command present in JAR's plugin.yml
- âœ… All required permissions defined
- âœ… JAR size: 147KB (normal size)

## Updated Plugin Ready
The new `skyeblock-1.1.0.jar` is ready for deployment to your external server.

## Expected Server Output
After fixing this issue, your server should show:
```
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] Enabling SkyeBlock v1.1.0
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] Loaded 4 island schematics
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] Created skyblock world: hub
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] Created skyblock nether world: skyblock_nether
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] Loaded 0 islands
[INFO] [SkyeBlock] SkyeBlock plugin enabled successfully!
```

## Next Steps
1. **Transfer new JAR** to your external server:
   ```bash
   cp target/skyeblock-1.1.0.jar /path/to/your/server/plugins/
   ```

2. **Replace old version** (remove any old skyeblock JAR files)

3. **Restart server** (full restart, not reload)

4. **Test commands**:
   ```
   /plugins  # Should show SkyeBlock v1.1.0 in green
   /island create classic  # Test island creation
   /convertislands scan    # Test conversion command
   ```

The plugin loading issue is now resolved! ðŸŽ‰
