# This is a placeholder .schem file for the desert island type
# In a real deployment, this would be a WorldEdit schematic file created by:
# 1. Building the desert island structure in-game
# 2. Selecting it with WorldEdit //wand
# 3. Copying with //copy
# 4. Saving with //schem save desert
#
# The desert island should include:
# - Sand platform with sandstone base
# - Cactus and dead bush
# - Chest with desert-appropriate starting items
#
# This file needs to be replaced with an actual .schem file
