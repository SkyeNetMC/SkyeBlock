# This is a placeholder .schem file for the nether island type
# In a real deployment, this would be a WorldEdit schematic file created by:
# 1. Building the nether island structure in-game
# 2. Selecting it with WorldEdit //wand
# 3. Copying with //copy
# 4. Saving with //schem save nether
#
# The nether island should include:
# - Netherrack platform
# - Nether fortress-style structures
# - Chest with nether-appropriate starting items
# - Lava source and nether plants
#
# This file needs to be replaced with an actual .schem file
