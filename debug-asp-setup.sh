echo "üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:"
echo "========================"
echo

echo "Option 1: Use ASP Server Only (Recommended)"
echo "-------------------------------------------"
echo "‚úÖ Keep: ASP server jar (built-in ASWM)"
echo "‚ùå Remove: ASWM plugin from plugins/"
echo "‚úÖ Keep: SkyeBlock plugin"
echo
echo "Commands:"
echo "  rm plugins/AdvancedSlimeWorldManager*.jar    # Remove ASWM plugin"
echo "  # Keep your ASP server jar as the main server"
echo

echo "Option 2: Use Regular Paper + ASWM Plugin"
echo "-----------------------------------------"
echo "‚ùå Replace: ASP server with regular Paper"
echo "‚úÖ Keep: ASWM plugin in plugins/"
echo "‚úÖ Keep: SkyeBlock plugin"
echo
echo "Commands:"
echo "  # Download regular Paper server jar"
echo "  # Keep ASWM plugin in plugins/"
echo

echo

echo "üîß DETECTION ENHANCEMENT:"
echo "========================"
echo "The SkyeBlock plugin has been enhanced to detect both:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Built-in ASWM (from ASP server)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Plugin-based ASWM"
echo
echo "But conflicts can occur when both are present!"

echo

echo "üìù TESTING STEPS:"
echo "=================="
echo
echo "1. Choose one option above"
echo "2. Copy the updated SkyeBlock plugin:"
echo "   cp target/skyeblock-1.0.0.jar plugins/"
echo
echo "3. Start your server and check logs for:"
echo "   ‚úÖ 'Found AdvancedSlimeWorldManager plugin, attempting to initialize...'"
echo "   ‚úÖ 'Advanced Slime World Manager integration initialized successfully!'"
echo
echo "4. Test in-game with '/island status' (as admin)"
echo "   Should show: 'World Manager: SlimeWorldManager (ASWM)'"
echo
echo "5. Create a test island and check creation speed:"
echo "   '/island create classic'"
echo "   Should be instant with ASWM working"

echo

echo "üö® TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "==================="
echo
echo "If still showing 'Standard Bukkit Worlds':"
echo
echo "1. Check server startup logs carefully"
echo "2. Look for plugin loading order issues"
echo "3. Ensure only ONE ASWM source (built-in OR plugin)"
echo "4. Try with a fresh server restart"
echo
echo "Debug commands:"
echo "  grep -i 'slime' logs/latest.log | tail -20"
echo "  grep -i 'skyeblock' logs/latest.log | tail -10"

echo
echo "üí° The enhanced SkyeBlock plugin now provides detailed"
echo "   logging to help identify exactly what's happening!"
