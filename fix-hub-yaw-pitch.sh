echo "üéØ SkyeBlock Hub Teleportation - Yaw & Pitch Fix"
echo "==============================================="
echo
echo "‚úÖ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   When using /hub command, players were always facing"
echo "   yaw=0 and pitch=0 regardless of the configuration"
echo "   values in config.yml"
echo
echo "üîß ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "   Two teleportation methods were not reading the yaw"
echo "   and pitch values from the configuration:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ HubCommand.java - /hub command"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ IslandManager.teleportToHub() - used when island is deleted"
echo
echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "========================"
echo "1. Fixed HubCommand.java:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added reading of hub.spawn.yaw and hub.spawn.pitch from config"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Updated Location constructor to include yaw and pitch parameters"
echo
echo "2. Fixed IslandManager.teleportToHub():"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added reading of hub.spawn.yaw and hub.spawn.pitch from config"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Updated Location constructor to include yaw and pitch parameters"
echo
echo "üìã CONFIGURATION REFERENCE:"
echo "==========================="
echo "In config.yml, these values are now properly used:"
echo "hub:"
echo "  spawn:"
echo "    x: 0.5"
echo "    y: 1"
echo "    z: 0.5"
echo "    yaw: -90.0   # NOW WORKING! (horizontal rotation)"
echo "    pitch: 0.0   # NOW WORKING! (vertical rotation)"
echo
echo "üéÆ YAW VALUES (horizontal rotation):"
echo "   ‚Ä¢   0¬∞ = Facing South"
echo "   ‚Ä¢  90¬∞ = Facing West" 
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 180¬∞ = Facing North"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 270¬∞ = Facing East"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ -90¬∞ = Facing East (same as 270¬∞)"
echo
echo "üéÆ PITCH VALUES (vertical rotation):"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ -90¬∞ = Looking straight up"
echo "   ‚Ä¢   0¬∞ = Looking straight ahead (horizon)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢  90¬∞ = Looking straight down"
echo
echo "üì¶ BUILD STATUS:"
echo "==============="
echo "‚úÖ Compilation successful"
echo "‚úÖ JAR file updated: target/skyeblock-2.5.7.jar"
echo
echo "üîç TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "========================"
echo "1. Copy the updated JAR to your server's plugins folder"
echo "2. Restart your server (or reload if safe to do so)"
echo "3. Test the /hub command"
echo "4. Player should now face the direction specified by yaw/pitch in config.yml"
echo
echo "Example test:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Set yaw: -90.0 in config.yml"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use /hub"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player should face East when teleported"
echo
echo "‚ú® Both /hub command and automatic hub teleportation"
echo "   (when island is deleted) now respect yaw and pitch!"
