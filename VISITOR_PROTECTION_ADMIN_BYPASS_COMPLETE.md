2. **`onBlockPlace`** - Prevents block placement  
3. **`onPlayerInteract`** - Controls block interactions (allows navigation)
4. **`onPlayerInteractEntity`** - Controls entity interactions
5. **`onEntityPickupItem`** - Prevents item pickup
6. **`onPlayerDropItem`** - Prevents item dropping
7. **`onInventoryOpen`** - Blocks container access
8. **`onInventoryClick`** - Prevents container manipulation
9. **`onEntityDamageByEntity`** - Prevents PVP
10. **`onGameModeChange`** - Enforces adventure mode

### Permission System
```yaml
# Core admin permissions
skyeblock.admin              # Access to /sba commands
skyeblock.admin.bypass       # Bypass all visitor restrictions

# Individual permissions automatically included
skyeblock.island.*           # All island permissions
skyeblock.admin.*            # All admin permissions
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 1. Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build the JAR
mvn clean package

# Deploy to server
cp target/skyeblock-*.jar /path/to/server/plugins/

# Restart server
systemctl restart minecraft
```

### 2. Permission Setup
```yaml
# Grant admin permissions
lp user <admin> permission set skyeblock.admin true
lp user <admin> permission set skyeblock.admin.bypass true

# Or use permission groups
lp group admin permission set skyeblock.admin true
lp group admin permission set skyeblock.admin.bypass true
```

### 3. Verification
```bash
# Test visitor protection
/island visit <player>  # Try to break blocks (should be blocked)

# Test admin bypass  
/sba visit <player>     # Should have full access
/sba create             # Should bypass cooldowns
```
