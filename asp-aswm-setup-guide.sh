# ASP Server + ASWM Plugin - Complete Setup Guide
echo "üéØ ASP Server + ASWM Plugin Setup Resolution"
echo "============================================"
echo

echo "üìä YOUR CURRENT SETUP:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "‚úÖ ASP Server Jar (with built-in ASWM)"
echo "‚úÖ ASWM Plugin installed"
echo "‚ùì SkyeBlock not detecting ASWM properly"
echo

echo "üîß ENHANCED PLUGIN READY!"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "The SkyeBlock plugin has been enhanced with:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Built-in ASWM detection (for ASP servers)"
echo "‚Ä¢ ASWM plugin detection (for separate plugins)"  
echo "‚Ä¢ Detailed debugging and logging"
echo "‚Ä¢ Conflict resolution between built-in and plugin ASWM"
echo

echo "üöÄ INSTALLATION STEPS:"
echo "======================"
echo

echo "1Ô∏è‚É£  UPDATE SKYEBLOCK PLUGIN:"
echo "   cp target/skyeblock-1.0.0.jar /path/to/your/server/plugins/"
echo "   # Replace with your actual server plugins path"
echo

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£  RESOLVE ASWM CONFLICT (Choose Option A or B):"
echo

echo "   OPTION A: Remove ASWM Plugin (Recommended)"
echo "   ------------------------------------------"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Keep: ASP server jar (has built-in ASWM)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Remove: ASWM plugin from plugins/"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Benefit: No conflicts, built-in ASWM is faster"
echo
echo "   Commands:"
echo "   rm plugins/AdvancedSlimeWorldManager*.jar"
echo "   # This removes the plugin, keeping built-in ASWM"
echo

echo "   OPTION B: Use ASWM Plugin Only"
echo "   ------------------------------"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Replace: ASP server with regular Paper jar"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Keep: ASWM plugin in plugins/"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Benefit: Plugin gets more frequent updates"
echo
echo "   Commands:"
echo "   # Download regular Paper from: https://papermc.io/"
echo "   # Replace your ASP server.jar with paper.jar"
echo

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£  RESTART SERVER COMPLETELY:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Stop server completely (not just reload)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Start server fresh"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Monitor startup logs carefully"
echo

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£  VERIFY INTEGRATION:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Run '/island status' in-game (as admin/op)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should show one of:"
echo "     ‚úÖ 'World Manager: SlimeWorldManager (ASWM Built-in)'"
echo "     ‚úÖ 'World Manager: SlimeWorldManager (ASWM)'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should NOT show: 'Standard Bukkit Worlds'"
echo

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£  TEST PERFORMANCE:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Run '/island create classic'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Should be INSTANT (not 5-10 seconds)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check memory usage - should be much lower"
echo

echo

echo "üîç DEBUGGING - What to Look For:"
echo "================================"
echo

echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS MESSAGES (in server logs):"
echo "   'Checking for built-in ASWM (ASP server)...'"
echo "   'Built-in Advanced Slime World Manager integration initialized successfully!'"
echo "   OR"
echo "   'Found AdvancedSlimeWorldManager plugin, attempting to initialize...'"
echo "   'Advanced Slime World Manager integration initialized successfully!'"
echo

echo "‚ùå CONFLICT MESSAGES (indicates you need to choose Option A or B):"
echo "   'Failed to initialize ASWM integration'"
echo "   'getLoader returned null'"
echo "   'Multiple ASWM sources detected'"
echo

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  FALLBACK MESSAGES (ASWM not working):"
echo "   'No compatible SlimeWorldManager found. Using standard world creation.'"
echo "   'Built-in ASWM API not found (not an ASP server)'"
echo

echo

echo "üìà EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "====================================="
echo "With ASWM working properly:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Island creation: Instant (vs 5-10 seconds)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Memory per island: ~1-5MB (vs 50-100MB)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Disk space per island: ~1-5MB (vs 10-50MB)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Server lag: Significantly reduced"
echo

echo

echo "üéØ RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "=================="
echo "For your setup, I recommend OPTION A:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Remove the ASWM plugin"
echo "‚Ä¢ Keep the ASP server jar"
echo "‚Ä¢ This eliminates conflicts and uses the faster built-in ASWM"
echo

echo "Commands to run:"
echo "rm plugins/AdvancedSlimeWorldManager*.jar"
echo "cp target/skyeblock-1.0.0.jar plugins/"
echo "# Then restart your server"

echo
echo "üìû After restart, check with:"
echo "   /island status"
echo "   Should show: 'World Manager: SlimeWorldManager (ASWM Built-in)'"
echo
echo "‚ú® The enhanced SkyeBlock plugin will now work with your ASP setup!"
