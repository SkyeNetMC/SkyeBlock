echo "   # Replace with your actual server path"
echo

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£  VERIFY ASWM INSTALLATION:"
echo "   Download ASWM from: https://infernalsuite.com/docs/asp/"
echo "   Ensure you have the PLUGIN version, not the server jar"
echo "   Place AdvancedSlimeWorldManager-X.X.X.jar in plugins/"
echo

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£  CHECK PLUGIN LOADING ORDER:"
echo "   ASWM must load BEFORE SkyeBlock"
echo "   Check server startup logs for loading order"
echo

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£  RESTART YOUR SERVER COMPLETELY:"
echo "   Stop server completely (not just reload)"
echo "   Start server fresh"
echo "   Monitor startup logs carefully"
echo

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£  TEST THE INTEGRATION:"
echo "   Run '/island status' in-game (as admin/op)"
echo "   Should show: 'World Manager: SlimeWorldManager (ASWM)'"
echo "   If it shows 'Standard Bukkit Worlds', ASWM is not detected"
echo

echo "6Ô∏è‚É£  CHECK SERVER LOGS:"
echo "   Look for these messages in logs/latest.log:"
echo "   ‚úÖ 'Found AdvancedSlimeWorldManager plugin, attempting to initialize...'"
echo "   ‚úÖ 'Advanced Slime World Manager integration initialized successfully!'"
echo "   ‚ùå 'Failed to initialize ASWM integration: ...'"
echo

echo "üìû COMMON ISSUES:"
echo
echo "‚ùå Issue: 'No compatible SlimeWorldManager found'"
echo "   Solution: Install ASWM plugin, restart server"
echo
echo "‚ùå Issue: 'Failed to initialize ASWM integration'"
echo "   Solution: Check ASWM version compatibility (use 3.0.0+)"

echo "üîç DEBUGGING COMMANDS:"
echo "   ./debug-aswm.sh                    # Run diagnostics"
echo "   grep -i 'slime' logs/latest.log    # Check logs for ASWM messages"
echo "   /island status                     # In-game status check"
echo

echo "üìà EXPECTED BENEFITS WHEN WORKING:"

echo "   ‚Ä¢ Disk space: ~90% reduction per island"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Better server performance overall"
