# GUI Click Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The VisitingSettingsGUI had a problem where after clicking one option (like lock/unlock or adventure mode toggle), subsequent clicks on other options would not register properly. This was caused by GUI refresh conflicts during inventory click event handling.

## Root Cause
- The original code was calling `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskLater()` to delay GUI refreshes
- This approach created timing conflicts and inventory state issues 
- Subsequent clicks would not register because the inventory state was inconsistent

## Solution Applied
- **Removed scheduled task approach**: Eliminated `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskLater()` calls
- **Direct refresh calls**: Now calls `refreshVisitingSettings(player, islandId)` immediately after state changes
- **Follows proven pattern**: Uses the same approach as `IslandSettingsGUI.refreshCurrentPage()`

## Changes Made
1. **Case 11 (Lock/Unlock toggle)**:
   - Removed: `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskLater(plugin, () -> { ... }, 1L);`
   - Added: Direct call to `refreshVisitingSettings(player, islandId);`

2. **Case 13 (Adventure mode toggle)**:
   - Removed: `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskLater(plugin, () -> { ... }, 1L);`
   - Added: Direct call to `refreshVisitingSettings(player, islandId);`

## Technical Details
- `refreshVisitingSettings()` method updates inventory items in-place
- Uses existing inventory reference via `player.getOpenInventory().getTopInventory()`
- Updates only dynamic items (slots 11 and 13) with current island states
- Calls `player.updateInventory()` to refresh client view without conflicts

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Click lock/unlock toggle → GUI updates immediately, showing new state
2. Click adventure mode toggle → GUI updates immediately, showing new state  
3. Click any other option → Works normally without conflicts
4. All subsequent clicks work properly without needing to close/reopen GUI

## Testing Instructions
1. Open island settings via `/is settings`
2. Navigate to "Visiting Settings"
3. Click lock/unlock toggle - verify it updates immediately
4. Click adventure mode toggle - verify it updates immediately
5. Click other options like "Set Home" or "Set Visit" - verify they work
6. Alternate between different options rapidly - verify no conflicts occur

This fix ensures consistent GUI behavior and eliminates the click registration issues.
